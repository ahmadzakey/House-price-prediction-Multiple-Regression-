# 🏠 Predicting Boston Housing Prices  

## 📄 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Boston suburbs using data from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The dataset includes features related to housing, neighborhoods, and environmental factors, providing a comprehensive view of what influences housing prices.  

The goal is to build an accurate **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** model to predict housing prices. Key steps include model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to ensure optimal performance.
